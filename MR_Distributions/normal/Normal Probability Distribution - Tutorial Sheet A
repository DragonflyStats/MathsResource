% The Normal Distribution
\smallskip
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume that Z scores are normally distributed with a mean of Zero and a
standard deviation of 1
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $P(0< Z < a)$ = 0.1915 Find a
\item[(ii)] $P(- b \leq Z \leq b)$ = 0.90 Find b
\item[(iii)] $P(- c \leq Z \leq c)$ = 0.99 Find c
\item[(iv)] $P(Z \leq d) = 0.3085$ Find d
\end{itemize}

\item 
Given the following information calculate the value of $z_1$ and $z_2$ using the normal tables.
$P(Z \geq z_2) = 0.0045$ and $P(z_1 \leq Z \leq z_2) = 0.0205$
%Note: 2 is the area under the curve between Z1 and Z2.


\item Assume that the length of injected moulded plastic components are normally
distributed with a mean of 10mm and a standard deviation of 2mm. Draw a rough
sketch and then calculate corresponding probability for the following measurements
occurring on an individual component:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Between 10 and 12.4mms
\item Less than 9.7 mms
\item Between 9.8 and 10.1 mms
\item Less than 10.3 mms
\end{enumerate}

\item The gestation period is approximately normally distributed with a mean of 275 days and a standard deviation of 4 days. Estimate the probability that the gestation period is 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item greater than 280 days
\item less than 265 days
\item between 272 and 283 days.
\item What gestation period is surpassed by 2.5\% of the population? 

\end{enumerate}

\item The length of the jump of an athlete has a normal distribution with mean 7m and standard deviation 0.1m. Calculate the probability that she jumps
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item at least 7.15m
\item no more than 7.15m
\item between 7.1m and 7.20m 
\item Find the probability that if she jumps 3 times all the jumps will be less than 7.15m (assume the lengths of the jumps are independent). 
\end{enumerate}

\item The amount of time required for routine automobile transmission service is normally distributed
with the mean 45 minutes and the standard deviation 8.0 minutes.
The service manager plans to have work begin on the transmission of a customer’s car 10 min after
the car is dropped off, and the customer is told that the car will be ready within 1 hour total time
(i.e. after the car is dropped off).
What is the probability that the service manager will be wrong?

\item   The weight of shire horses is assumed to have a normal distribution with mean 1000kg and standard
deviation 50kg.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Calculate the probability that the mass of a shire horse is more than 970kgs.
        \item Calculate the probability that the mass of a shire horse is no more than 1035kg.
\item Calculate the probability that the mass of a shire horse is between 945kg and 1035kg.
\item What weight is exceeded by 2.5\% of shire horses? 
\end{enumerate}

\item 
The lifetime of an electrical component is known to follow a normal distribution with a
mean of 2,000 hours and a standard deviation of 200 hours.
Compute the probability that a randomly selected component will last
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item more than 2,220 hours,
\item between 2,000 and 2,400 hours.
\end{enumerate}

\item 
A Physical Education teacher in a secondary school is marking performance of students on the high
jump coming up to their end of year exams. For the given age group published data suggest a mean
jumping height of 1.5m and standard deviation of 10cm and the data are considered to be normally distributed. The
teacher wishes to distribute marks according to the normal curve and have the following
proportions allotted for grades.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
A&  B & C & D & \\
20\% &  64\% & 14\% &  2\%& (100\%)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Draw a sketch of the normal distribution. On the axis mark the mean height. Calculate what heights
will be required in order for students to attain the A, B, C and D grades. Mark these onto your
sketch.
