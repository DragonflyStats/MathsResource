### Carmichael numbers
 
a carmichael nuimber is a composite positive integer n which satisfies the congruence
  for all integers b which are relatively prime to n (from modular arithmetic)
 
Fermat's little theorem
 
If P is a prime number and "a" is a natural number then
 
apa[mod(p)]

### Discrete Logarithm problem
 
Let a+b =n
if         a2= kmod(n)
then     b2= kmod(n)
 62mod(23)= 13
 172mod(23)= 13
