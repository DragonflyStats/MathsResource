Water meters were installed in a sample of houses, with the following results:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item Identify the dependent and independent variables.
	
	\item Represent the data in a scatterplot, showing the relevant axes.
	
	\item Calculate the coefficient of linear correlation.
	\item What can you conclude from your results in parts (ii) and parts (iii)?
        \item Add the line of best fit to the completed scatterplot in (ii).
    \item Use the line of best fit to estimate the weekly consumption of a household with 5 occupants.    
	\item By taking suitable readings from your digram, or otherwise, calculate the line of best fit.
\item Explain how to interpret the slope of the line in this context.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Suppose that instead of measuring the water consumption in litres, the engineers had measured the water 
consumption in gallons. If you were to convert the values in the table above from litres to gallons, what effect would this have on the correlation correlation? (\noindent \textbf{Remark:} \textit{one gallon = 4.55 litres)}.

\newpage\subsection*{Old Question 9}

\begin{itemize}


\item[(a)]

When a loan of $\euro P$ is repaid in equal repayments of amount $\euro A$, at the end of each of $t$ equal
periods of time, where $i$ is the periodic compound interest rate (expressed as a decimal), the formula below
can be used to find the amount of each repayment.

\[ A = P \frac{i(1+i)^t}{((1+i)^t -1)} \]
Show how this formula is derived. You may use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series.

\item[(b)]
 Alex has a credit card $\euro 5000$. One method of clearing this debt is to make a fixed repayment at the end of each month.
	
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item What is the fixed monthly repayment, $\euro A$, required to repay the debt of $\euro 5000$.
\item The annual percentage (APR) charged on debt by the credit card company is $21.75\%$, fixed for the term of the debt.
Find as a percentage, correct to 3 significant figures, the monthly interest rate that is equivalent to an APR of $21.75\%$.
\item Assume Alex pays the fixed monthly repayment $\euro A$, each month and does not have any further transactions on that card.
Complete the table below to show how the balance of the debt $\euro 5000$ is reducing each month for the first three months, assuming
an APR of $21.75\%$, charged and compounded monthly.

card of $\euro 5000$, using the repayment method outlined at the beginning of \textbf{part (b)} above.
Give your answer in months, correct to the nearest month.

\item Alex decides to borrow $\euro 5000$ from the local Credit Union to pay off this credit card debt of $\euro 5000$.
The APR charge for the Credit Union Loan is $8.5\%$ fixed for the term of the loan. The loan is to be repaid in equal weekly repayments, at the
end of each week, for 156 weeks. Find the amount of each weekly repayment.
