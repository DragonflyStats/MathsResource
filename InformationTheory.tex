Information Theory
 
Information theory is fundamentally concerned with two distinct topics:
 
Compression: This refers to the idea of removing redundancy from a source of information, so
as to (losslessly) store it using as few bits as possible.
 
Coding: This refers to the idea of adding redundancy to a source of information, so that the
original message can be recovered if some of the stored bits are corrupted.
