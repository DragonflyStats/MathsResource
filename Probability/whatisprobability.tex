\begin{itemize}
\item Probability theory is the mathematical study of randomness. A
probability model of a random experiment is defined by assigning
probabilities to all the different outcomes.
\item Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will
occur. Thus, probabilities can be used as measures of degree of
uncertainty associated with outcomes of an experiment.
Probability values are always assigned on a scale from 0 to 1.
\item A probability of 0 means that the event is impossible, while
a probability near 0 means that it is highly unlikely to occur.
\item Similarly an event with probability 1 is certain to occur, whereas an
event with a probability near to 1 is very likely to occur.
