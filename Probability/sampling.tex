\begin{enumerate}	
\item Suppose an urn contains seven white, four black and three red beads. Three beads are picked at random without replacement.
	Find the probability that all three beads are the different in colour.
	at least two beads are the same colour.
	\begin{itemize}	
		%----------------------------------------------------------%
		\item[(i)] A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?
		
	\end{itemize}
\item 
	Suppose one urn contains three balls; one red, one blue and one green, and a second urn contain three balls; numbered 1, 2, and 3. An experiment consists of two balls being drawn at random (i.e. one from each urn).
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[(i)]  Write out the sample space for this experiment.
