{

\textbf{Probability Trees: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two gamblers, A and B, are playing each other in a tournament to win a jackpot worth $\$6,000$. 
\item The first gambler to win 5 rounds, wins the tournament, and the jackpot outright.
\item Each player has an equal chance of winning each round. Also, a tie is not possible.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Probability Trees: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item The tournament is suspended after the seventh round. At this point A has won 3 rounds, while B has won 4.
\item They agree to finish then and divide up the jackpot, according to how likely an outright victory would have been for both.
\end{itemize}
How much money did A end up with?

\textbf{Probability Trees: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider that A needed to win two more rounds, while B only need to win one more.
\item One could suppose that B was twice as likely as A to win the jackpot.
\item That would mean that the shares of the jackpot would be $\$2,000$ for A and 
$\$4,000$ for B.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Probability Trees: Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item At the end of the seventh round, A had a $25\%$ chance of winning the jackpot.
\item A's share of the jackpot is  the $\$1,500$.
\item B had a $75\%$ chance of winning, so gets $\$4,500$.

{Probability Trees}

\begin{itemize}

\item A probability tree diagram shows all the possible events.
\item The first event is represented by a dot.
\item From the dot, branches are drawn to represent all possible outcomes of the event.
\item The probability of each outcome is written on its branch.
\item How do you calculate the overall probabilities?
\begin{itemize}
\item You multiply probabilities along the branches
\item You add probabilities down columns
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
