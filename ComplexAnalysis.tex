The main topics taught in the course are as follows: an introduction to complex numbers, regions in the complex plane, complex functions, the complex logarithm function, the derivative of a complex function, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, harmonic functions, holomorphic functions and their properties, complex integrals, Cauchy's Integral Theorem, Cauchy's Integral Formulae, Taylor and Laurent series, the calculus of residues, Cauchy's Residue Theorem. Rigorous proofs of some of the theorems in this module, such as Cauchy's Integral Theorem, belong to a more advanced course but, where possible, weaker versions of such theorems are proved.
