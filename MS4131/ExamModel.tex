\subsection*{Quesiton 2}

2) Inverting a Matrix using Co-Factors
	Matrix of Minors
	Determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix

\begin{itemize}	
\item Evaluate the  minors and cofactors of $A$, for $A$ given by

\begin{eqnarray*}
& &\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!A=\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 3 & \!\!\!\!-1\\
0 & 1 & 3\\
\!\!\!\!-3 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right);\qquad A=\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 5 & 4\\
0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 7
\end{array} \right);\\
& &\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!A=\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 3 & 4\\
8 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right);\qquad A=\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 3 & 4\\
0 & 1 & 1\\
\!\!\!\!-6 & 0 & \!\!\!\!-1
\end{array} \right).
\end{eqnarray*}
and hence, in each case, construct the cofactor matrix $\textnormal{Cof(A)}$ of $A$.
\end{itemize}

1. Let A and B be $m \times n$ matrices. Then:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $(kA)^T = kA^T$
\item[(ii)] $(A+B)^T = A^T + B^T$
\item[(iii)] $(AB)^T = B^TA^T$
\end{itemize}

2. Let a triangular matrix be a square matrix with either all $(i,j)$ entries zero for either $i<j$ 
(in which case it is called an lower triangular matrix) or for $j<i$ (in which case it is called an upper triangular matrix). 
Show that any triangular matrix satisfying $AA^T = A^TA$ is a diagonal matrix.

3. For a square matrix A show that:

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $AA^T$ and $A+A^T$ are symmetric
\item[(ii)] $A-A^T$ is skew symmetric
\item[(iii)] A can be expressed as the sum of a symmetric matrix, $\frac{1}{2}(A+A^T)$ and a skew 
symmetric matrix $\frac{1}{2}(A-A^T)$
\end{itemize}

4. Suppose A is a m×n matrix and x is a $n \times 1$ column vector. Show that if 
\[x=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{pmatrix}\] and 
\[A=\begin{pmatrix}c_1 & c_2 &\cdots c_n \end{pmatrix} where c_j=\begin{pmatrix}A_{1j}\\A_{2j}\\\vdots\\A_{mj}\end{pmatrix}\]
 then \[Ax = x_1c_1+x_2c_2+\cdots x_nc_n. \]

This is also expressed by saying that Ax is a linear combination of the columns of A.
