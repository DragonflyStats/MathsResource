\subsection*{Quantiles}
Recall


The quantile function is the inverse of the cumulative
distribution function. The p-quantile is the value with the
property that there is probability p of getting a value less than
or equal to it. The median is by definition the 50\% quantile.


Theoretical quantiles are commonly used for the calculation of
confidence intervals and for power calculations in connection with
designing and dimensioning experiments.
