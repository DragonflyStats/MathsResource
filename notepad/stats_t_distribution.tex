The $t$ distribution is the appropriate basis for
determining the standardized test statistic when the sampling
distribution of the mean is normally distributed but $s$ is not
known. The sampling distribution can be assumed to be normal
either because the population is normal or because the sample is
large enough to invoke the central limit theorem. \\ The $t$
distribution is required when the sample is small ($n < 30$). For
larger samples, normal approximation can be used. For the critical
value approach, the procedure is identical to that described in
Section 10.3 for the normal distribution, except for the use of $t$
instead of z as the test statistic.
