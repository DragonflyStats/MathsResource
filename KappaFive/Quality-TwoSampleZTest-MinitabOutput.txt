Two-Sample T-Test and CI: Measurement, Factory 

Two-sample T for Measurement

Factory      N     Mean  StDev  SE Mean
FactoryA  2400  1002.60   1.76    0.036
FactoryB  2600  1002.72   1.64    0.032


Difference = µ (FactoryA) - µ (FactoryB)
Estimate for difference:  -0.1248
95% upper bound for difference:  -0.0456
T-Test of difference = 0 (vs <): T-Value = -2.59  P-Value = 0.005  DF = 4998
Both use Pooled StDev = 1.7011
