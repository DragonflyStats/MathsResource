\section*{Question 2 - Experimental Design (Compulsory)}
	\subsubsection*{Part A - One Way ANOVA (10 Marks)}
The R\&D team from a manufacturer of advanced composite materials is testing
the Stiffness of a new composite material. Stiffness is a function of the percentage
concentration of a particular compound within the composite material. \\ \smallskip


\noindent The R\&D team investigated the Stiffness for 5 different percentage levels of the compound, A=5\%,
B=7.5\%, C=10\%,  D =12.5\% and E = 15\%. \\
\smallskip
\noindent The data from the test was collected and is given below. Higher
scores indicate higher Stiffness.

\subsection*{Part C - Multiple Linear Regression (8 Marks)}

A multinational software company that sells products in several sales regions,
each assigned to a single sales representative, is interested in the variables that
influence sales.
\begin{framed}
\noindent The variables are:

\begin{description}
	\item[Sales:] Total sales credited to the sales representative
	\item[Time:] Length of time employed in months
	\item[Poten:] Market potential; total industry sales in units for the sales region
	\item[AdvExp:] Advertising expenditure in the sales region
	\item[Share:] Market share; weighted average for the past 4 years
	\item[Change:] Change in market share over the previous 4 years
	\item[Accounts:] Number of accounts assigned to the sales representative
	\item[Work:] Workload; a weighted index based on annual purchases and
concentrations of accounts.
	\item[Rating:] Sales representatives overall rating on eight performance dimensions;
an aggregate rating on a 1-7 scale.
\end{description}
\end{framed}
\noindent A random sample of 50 sales regions resulted in a data set that was then entered into
Minitab and the following printout was generated.\\
\medskip

\noindent Write a brief report analysing the printout. In your report comment on how well
the model explains the variability in sales.
Which variable or variables appear to be good predictors of sales?
Would you refine the model in the light of these results? If so, what changes
would you make?

\subsubsection*{Question 4 Part A (25 Marks)}

In an investigation into the extraction of nitrate-nitrogen from air dried soil, three quantitative variables were investigated at two levels. These were the amount of oxidised activated charcoal (A) added to the extracting solution to remove organic interferences, the strength of CaSO4 extracting solution (C), and the time the soil was shaken with the solution (T). The aim of the investigation was to optimise the extraction procedure. The levels of the variables are given here:
