Use Laplace transforms to solve the heat equation

            ut=c2uxx
 
on the semi-infinite domain
 
         0 x <,14cm  0t <,
 
subject to
(i) ux(0, t) = -1, t > 0;
(ii) u(x, t) -> 0, as x -> 1;
(iii) u(x, 0) = 0, x > 0.

Consider the wave equation utt=c2uxx for the semi-infinite string
0x < and t0, with
u(x, 0) =xe-5(x-1)2
ut(x, 0) = 0; u(0, t) = 0:
Formulate the discretised problem using an explicit finite difference method on a uniform mesh (taking central differences to approximate the 2nd derivatives).

Spring 2008 Q4d
 
Consider the partial differential equation
                uxx + 3uxt + 2utt = 0 :
Use the transformation = x-t, = x -t2 to reduce the equation to a simpler form and determine the general solution u(x; t).

Hence find the particular solution that satisfies the boundary conditions    

u(x; 0) = x2 ; ut(x; 0) = 0 :
