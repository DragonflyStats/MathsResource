	\textbf{Sequences and Series}\\
	\begin{itemize}
\item In this chapter we’ll be taking a look at sequences and (infinite) series. 
\item Actually, this chapter will deal almost exclusively with series. 
\item However, we also need to understand some of the basics of sequences in order to properly deal with series.  
\item We will therefore, spend a little time on sequences as well.
\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Series is one of those topics that many students don’t find all that useful. \item To be honest, many students will never see series outside of their calculus class. \item However, series do play an important role in the field of ordinary differential equations and without series large portions of the field of partial differential equations would not be possible.
\end{itemize}

In other words, series is an important topic even if you won’t ever see any of the applications.  Most of the applications are beyond the scope of most Calculus courses and tend to occur in classes that many students don’t take.  So, as you go through this material keep in mind that these do have applications even if we won’t really be covering many of them in this class.
