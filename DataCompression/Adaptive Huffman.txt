Adaptive Huffman coding
==========================
Definition: A near-minimal variable-length character coding that changes based on the frequency of characters processed. 
As characters are processed, frequencies are updated and codes are changed (or, the coding tree is modified).

####  Motivation
The basic Huffman algorithm has been extended, for the following reasons:

(a) The previous algorithms require the statistical knowledge which is often not available (e.g., live audio, video).

(b) Even when it is available, it could be a heavy overhead especially when many tables had to be sent when a non-order0 model is used, i.e. taking into account the impact of the previous symbol to the probability of the current symbol (e.g., "qu" often come together, ...).
