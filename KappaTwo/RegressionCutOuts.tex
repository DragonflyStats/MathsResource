\item[(b)] In an experiment to determine hydrolysable tannins in plants by absorption spectroscopy, the following results from ten samples were obtained and are tabulated below. A simple linear regression model, predicting absorbance values using concentration as the independent variable, was fitted to the data. The scatterplot is depicted below.
%%Absorbance= c(0.084, 0.183, 0.326, 0.464, 0.643, 0.707, 0.717, 0.734 ,0.749 ,0.732) ;
%%Concentration= c(0.123, 0.288, 0.562, 0.921, 1.420, 1.717, 1.921, 2.137 ,2.321, 2.467) ;
%%plot(Concentration,Absorbance,pch=18,col="red",font.axis=2,font.lab=2)
%%abline(coef(lm(Absorbance~Concentration)))

%%Conc.Squared = (Concentration^2)
%%Conc.Cubed = (Concentration^3)
%%ModelA = lm(Absorbance~Concentration)
%%ModelB = lm(Absorbance~Concentration+Conc.Squared)
