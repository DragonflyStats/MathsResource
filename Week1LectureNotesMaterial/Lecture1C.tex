Then f is even if the following equation holds for all x and -x in the domain of f:[1]

\[f(x) = f(-x), \,\]

Geometrically speaking, the graph face of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after reflection about the y-axis.
Examples of even functions are |x|, x2, x4, cos(x), and cosh(x).

\frametile{Odd functions}




Æ’(x) = x3 is an example of an odd function.
Again, let f(x) be a real-valued function of a real variable. Then f is odd if the following equation holds for all x and -x in the domain of f:[2]

-f(x) = f(-x), \,
or

f(x) + f(-x) = 0. \,
Geometrically, the graph of an odd function has rotational symmetry with respect to the origin, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after rotation of 180 degrees about the origin.
Examples of odd functions are x, x3, sin(x), sinh(x), and erf(x).
