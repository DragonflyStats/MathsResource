Force of Interest

The Force of interest (t) is a function of time and at any time t measured in years is given by
 


1) Calculate the accumuation at time t= 10 of £500 invested at time t=0 years.
2) Calculate the PV at time t=0 of a continuous payment stream ar rate of £200e0.1t paid from t=10 to t=18.
 
1) Solution
 
Accumulation \[A = exp \left( \int_0^{10} \delta(s) ds )\]
 
\[A = exp \left( \int_0^8 (0.07-0.005s) ds \right) + exp \left(\int_8^{10}(0.06) ds
\] 

\[A = 500 \times exp(0.40 + 0.12) = 841.01
 \]
