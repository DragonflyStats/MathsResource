Irish Independent Article on emigration forecasts.
5,000 will leave each month over job crisis
(120,000 to emigrate by end of next year, ESRI predicts)

By Brendan Keenan (Irish Independent Wednesday July 14 2010)

MORE than 120,000 people -- or 5,000 a month -- will emigrate by the end of next year to escape unemployment at home, the State's economic think tank warns in its latest report.
That means the equivalent population of Cork city will leave over the next 18 months.
The figure is 20,000 more than the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) estimated in its last report, just three months ago.
Jean Goggin, a co-author of the report, said: "It's quite significant -- we expect 70,000 to leave in 2010 and a further 50,000 in 2011."


Comments:
120,000 will are  forecase to emigrate, but in what time period? The period betwen January 2010 and December 2011 is likely.
