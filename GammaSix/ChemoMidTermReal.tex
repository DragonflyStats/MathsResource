\section*{Polynomial Regression}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Polynomial regression models are useful in situations where the analyst knows that \textit{\textbf{curvilinear effects}} are present in the response variable.
	\item Polynomial models are also useful as approximating functions to unknown and possible very complex nonlinear relationship.
\end{itemize}


In the context of Statistical Modelling, what is means the ``Law of Parsimony".

What is the Akaike information criterion? How would you use it in statical modelling? How does it differ from other metrics such as the 
coefficient of determination. How would you interpret an AIC value.

compare and contrast forward selection and backward selection as variable selection procedures.

In the context of Statistical Modelling,What is meant by Stepwise regression?

Explain why an adjusted R2 value is often preferred to R2
when comparing
models.

%=============================================================%
Usual assumptions are that the residual (error) terms should be independent,
identically distributed, have zero mean and constant variance, and, if the usual
inferences and tests are to be made, be Normally distributed.
